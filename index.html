                <h2>My Favorite Sport</h2>
                <p>My favorite sport is basketball. I have been playing since the seventh grade, and I have won many championships through school, including MVP my senior year. Basketball has gotten me through many tough moments in life, and I wouldn't choose any other sport!</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
                <p>My favorite food is pizza. Every single time I get hungry and there is no food at the house, I always order pizza. There are so many different types of pizza one can buy, so you never really run out of options. Pizza will always be my go-to food!</p>

                <h2>My Hobby</h2>
                <p>My hobby that has significantly grown over the last year is weightlifting. I used to be a really thin kid, which made me insecure about my body. Ever since I started weightlifting, I started putting on a lot more muscle, thus making me a lot more comfortable in my own skin. I am very motivated now to continue weightlifting and see how far I can push my body!</p>

                <h2>My Love for Sneakers</h2>
                <p>Ever since I started playing basketball, my love for sneakers has grown uncontrollably. I started watching shoe reviews on YouTube every day, looking at shoes I couldn't even afford at the time. As I got older, I then had the money to go and buy these sneakers, leading to a large collection that I have no shame about. I love collecting sneakers, and I don't think I will stop till the day I leave this earth!</p>
